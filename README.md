# Zaghlol
Zaghlol is a Self-balancing robot and obstacle detection using PID controller.

Problem description:
The problem of the balancing robot is essentially solving the classic inverted pendulum problem.
The goal of the control loop is to adjust the wheels’ position so that the inclination angle remains stable at a pre-determined value (e.g. the angle when the robot is balanced). When the robot starts to fall in one direction, the wheels should move in the falling direction to correct the inclination angle.
